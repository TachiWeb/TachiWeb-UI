# TachiWeb-UI
TachiWeb-UI is the web frontend for TachiServer.

# About
*TachiWeb-UI is a component of TachiWeb, an attempt to port [Tachiyomi](https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi) to the desktop.*

TachiWeb-UI is a UI for TachiServer which attempts to implement as much of the functionality present in Tachiyomi as possible.
It currently copies almost every element of it's design from Tachiyomi, optimizations to the desktop platform will be made later.

TachiWeb is not officially supported by Tachiyomi or it's contributors.

# Live demo
A live demo is available here: [http://64.137.238.70:4567/](http://64.137.238.70:4567/)
**NOTE**: Kissmanga is very unstable. Batoto normally requires log in but in the demo, I will use my own credentials.
The demo server is also very cheap so don't expect images to load very fast.
Please don't destroy the live demo.

# Features
- Almost the entire Tachiyomi UI has been implemented!
- Simple RTL and LTR paging reader implemented.

# Installation
See the [TachiWeb-Server README](https://github.com/TachiWeb/TachiWeb-Server#installation).

# Architecture
The Javascript code is not very neat and currently needs a lot of refactoring, although I know how to write Javascript, I am not well-acquainted with it's best practices and design patterns.

# State
TachiWeb-UI is usable, but still **alpha** software.
There are probably still many bugs present, if you find one, please report it by creating an issue.
Performance is currently very good and the UI is quite fluid.
Many buttons/elements of the UI still do nothing and are unimplemented, they will implemented eventually but usually higher priority features are implemented first.
